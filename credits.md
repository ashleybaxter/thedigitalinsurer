### Picons
[Picons.me](http://picons.me) royalty-free vector icons ([License](http://picons.me/license.php)).

Due to the fact that I wasn't entirely sure wether it would be permitted to use these beautiful icons for the intended purpose, I asked the author for permission and received one via email. This theme just uses very few icons from the set — please support the author and purchase the entire library if you'd like to extend it.
